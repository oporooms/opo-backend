This project uses Node.js, Express, dotenv, and follows a basic Model-Controller-View (MCV) structure. Use best practices for Node.js and Express development.
Focus on writing clean, maintainable code. Ensure that you handle errors gracefully and validate user input. Use environment variables for sensitive information and configuration settings.

When suggesting code, consider the following:
- Follow the project's coding conventions and style guide.
- Provide clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
- Include error handling and input validation where appropriate.
- Write unit tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass.
- Keep security best practices in mind, especially when dealing with user input and authentication.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations to improve readability.
