# opo-backend

A Node.js backend project using Express, dotenv, and TypeScript, following a basic Model-Controller structure.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file (already included) and set your environment variables.
3. Start the server:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/index.ts`: Entry point (TypeScript)
- `.env`: Environment variables
- Model and Controller are in `src/index.ts` for simplicity

## Customization
Expand the structure by separating models and controllers as needed.
